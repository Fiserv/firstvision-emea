# 2023 Micro 8 Release Notes

## Date: *05/05/2023*

### General Changes

#### *Enhanced key block length for better security*
 
We have increased the key block length of encryption for better security for Encrypted PIN and Encrypted CVV Inquiry APIs. </br>
This change means that our encryption method now uses longer key blocks making it more difficult for attackers to decrypt the data. </br>
These key block changes do not require any changes from client end.
